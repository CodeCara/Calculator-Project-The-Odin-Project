Updated operate divide functions to account for zeros entered as denominators.  When the alert window 
is closed, the result (infinity)remains in the display.  Best way to handle/reset this?
Maybe update the display message with something funny and prompt to clear to reset the calc......
...do this then push to git


Write CLEAR function first..


- implement running calc on top of display screen/change AND/OR highlight buttons

- change order or + and equals button?//NO

- add a delete button?
