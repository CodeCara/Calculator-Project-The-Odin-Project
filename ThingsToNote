//THINGS TO NOTE

//The display and currentCalculation are aligned, but may not appear do due to 
//font size difference

//The alignment of the error message could have been improved

//Decided to round non-integers to 6 places

//Maybe a few lines of redundant code

//Very little refactoring done on this project




//BUG FIXING
//2 Aug, bug fixed
//2 Aug, trying to implment ability to continue calculations AFTER = has been pressed....line 233 for relevant code
//currently trying to fix at line 160

//3 Aug 24, bug fixed; equalsButton function essentially duplicated the operate function and was called within...
//the operate function, which threw errors (even though the app appeared to work).

//3 Aug 24, Since bug fix on 2 Aug, the display number had started showing the operator as well
//...as the number.  Fixed this today.

//3 Aug 24: Noticed that dividing by 0 error prevents calculations when the denominator is 
>0 and <1 also,  Fixed today
