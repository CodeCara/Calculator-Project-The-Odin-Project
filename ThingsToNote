//THINGS TO NOTE

//The display and currentCalculation are aligned, but may not appear do due to 
//font size difference

//The alignment of the error message could have been improved

//Decided to round non-integers to 6 places

//Maybe a few lines of redundant code

//Very little refactoring done on this project

//The equalsButton function was created to avoid an infinite loop within the operate function


//2 Aug, bug fixed
//2 Aug, trying to implment ability to continue calculations AFTER = has been pressed....line 233 for relevant code
//currently trying to fix at line 160
