NEED TO CONVERT NUMBER STRINGS TO NUMBERS!

25/7 MULTI DIGIT NOT WORKING FOR SECOND NUMBER...FIX FUNC LINE 210

//27/7/...9.15am........result of FIRST calculation is now appearing as firstNumber! after reginning functions....try to clean everything up and retry

28/7


...need to workign from line 260.  getSecondNumb is casuing inf loop

check from line 274

line 356, this is where the + trigger is . the getSecondNumber part?

display.innerText= secondNumber;....check this line

line 251: display.innerText= secondNumber

from line 230 really impo. changed resulat already calc to false!!!! think the error is here

check line 287


CHECK FROM LINE 249!!!!! HOW SECOND NUM AFTER RRESULT IS WORKED OUT!

line 257 diplay = second Number
37, display = result

I think 249 is the problem...new events being added to OLD second number
